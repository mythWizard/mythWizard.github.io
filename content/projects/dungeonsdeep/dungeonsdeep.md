Dungeons Deep will be a 3D Rogue-like game built in Godot. It primarily uses assets created by [Kay Lousberg](https://kaylousberg.itch.io/) and [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/).

The idea for this game has really been floating around in my head since I worked on [R@ Slayer]({{< ref "projects/ratslayer/ratslayer.md" >}}) in undergrad. I always wanted to finish that game but nothing I wrote ever felt quite right. In September of 2022, I found Kay Lousberg's [Dungeon Pack](https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-dungeon) and that sparked some inspiration. With this and the [Skeletons Pack](https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-skeletons), I set to work right then.

I was afraid that this would end up like every project I've started so far, though. That is to say, a sad, broken mess with no future. So I challenged myself to self-publish this game. My plan is to finish this game by the end of 2023 and publish it on my currently very empty [itch.io page](https://mythwizard.itch.io/).

I plan to start posting devlogs for this game more regularly, to help keep myself accountable. I didn't start managing versions until partway through the alpha phase and didn't start using version control until later. I will post backdated devlogs for the alpha versions I do have records for in Notion.

Demo builds are currently available on [itch.io](https://mythwizard.itch.io/dungeons-deep).
