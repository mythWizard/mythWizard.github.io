In March of 2023, while working on [Dungeons Deep]({{< ref "/projects/dungeonsdeep/dungeonsdeep.md" >}}), I imported a tile from [Kay Lousberg's](https://kaylousberg.itch.io/) [Medieval Builder Pack](https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kaykit-medieval-builder-pack) and I jotted down a note in my Notion workspace to create a cozy, real-time, Civilization-esque game. This was going to be the second game in my "self-publish one game a year" series.

I wanted this game to be low-stakes. Traditionally, a [4X Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X) has four goals: "Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate". The fourth X, Exterminate, refers to defeating other players. I had planned for this to be a single-player medieval(-ish, I'm using all the assets I can get) city builder, so the fourth X doesn't quite apply here. There will still be enemies and challenges, but they are not player-controlled, just environmental hazards that need to be defended against or removed for your kingdom's safety. Thus, I'm calling this a 3X game. It has yet to be titled, but I want it to be a more relaxing, low-key take on the city builder genre.
