One of the things I enjoy doing in my free time (when I get free time) is rewriting arcade games. I have cloned games like [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) and [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris). Both of these games are implemented in C++ using Allegro 5 for keyboard input, audio, and graphics.

My most recent project in this series is a clone of a game called [DeathBall](https://deathball.cab), which I discovered at an arcade in Morgantown, West Virginia with some friends. I decided to use [Unity](https://unity3d.com) to recreate this game since it required a bit more physics than I was willing to try implementing on my own. I do not plan to post this one on Github for potential issues with copywrite.
