Welcome to a new devlog series for my second full game attempt. This project is currently codenamed "Cozy Civ".

The first build of this game is fairly simple. It includes five tile types and their variants with paths / roads:
- Grass
- Sand
- Rock
- Water
- Snow

It also includes a whole slew of resources and buildings.

Lastly, it implements simplex noise for simple biome generation with height variation and resource placement on the world map.
