This is actually the build where I came up with the name for Dungeons Deep.

It also fixed a couple of fun bugs I had where:

- Character selection wouldn't highlight the current character
- Character selection covers the gameplay window if the player starts a new game after losing
- Enemies can still attack the player on the same turn they die
