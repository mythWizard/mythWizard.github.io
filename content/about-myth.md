I'm mythWizard. I am the Storyteller and this is my Library.

The username "mythWizard" comes from my high school classical mythology class. I dove headlong into the [textbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23522.Mythology) and read the whole thing within the first few weeks of the course. I had also already read [Percy Jackson](https://rickriordan.com/book/the-lightning-thief/), in fact, I had read the whole series up to that point. Needless to say, I was over-prepared for that class and so I was acing the quizzes, tests, assignments, and [Quizlets](https://quizlet.com/). I decided midway through the class that I should create an account on Quizlet so that I could have my score properly attributed to me since I was battling another student in my class for the top of the leaderboards. One friend made an off-hand comment that "You are like a myth wizard". That combined with my attempts at self-teaching programming plus [Pesterchum handles](https://www.homestuck.com/) resulted in the username "mythWizard".

Now to the present:

I'm a software developer at a small company located in the Shenandoah Valley. I joined them while on a leave of abscence from my M.S./Ph.D. program and ultimately ended up staying there, leaving academia behind entirely.

I live with my girlfriend, KP, and our two dogs, Korra and Kasper. She and I are vegan, the dogs are not.

By night, I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mythWizard), post VoDs on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@myth_wizard), and [make video games](https://mythwizard.itch.io/). I also thoroughly enjoy homebrewing beer, brewing coffee (espresso, French press, cold brew), learning new programming languages and natural languages (particularly German), over-engineering my home network, and reading just about anything I can get my hands on. At home, I do most of the cooking, since I find it relaxing and fulfilling. I'm attempting to recreate foods I find in video games and books. My current projects are the [Nutrient Block](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Nutrient_Block_(Subnautica)) and [Mek](https://wayfarers.fandom.com/wiki/Mek). I'll probably post them in [Projects]({{< ref projects >}}) or [Posts]({{< ref posts >}}) when I get it figured out.

I'm also interested in crafting a more sustainable lifestyle for myself. I try to engage in more low waste tendencies, bringing bags to the store, recycling, composting, eating everytihing we buy from the store. I commute to and from work on my [e-bike](https://ride1up.com/product/prodigy/) and run as many errands on it as I can, though I need to upgrade my kit for it. My backpack can only hold so much. Lately, I've found myself exploring as much of Solarpunk art, literature, and video(game) content as I can.
