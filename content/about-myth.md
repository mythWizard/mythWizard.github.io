I'm a software developer at a small company located in the Shenandoah Valley. I joined them while on a leave of abscence from my M.S./Ph.D. program and ultimately ended up staying there, leaving academia behind entirely.

I live with my girlfriend, KP, and our two dogs, Korra and Kasper. She and I are vegan, the dogs are not.

By night, I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mythWizard), post VoDs on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@myth_wizard), and [make video games](https://mythwizard.itch.io/). I also thoroughly enjoy homebrewing beer, brewing coffee (espresso, French press, cold brew), learning new programming languages and natural languages (particularly German), over-engineering my home network, and reading just about anything I can get my hands on. At home, I do most of the cooking, since I find it relaxing and fulfilling. I'm attempting to recreate foods I find in video games and books. My current projects are the [Nutrient Block](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Nutrient_Block_(Subnautica)) and [Mek](https://wayfarers.fandom.com/wiki/Mek). I'll probably post them in [Projects]({{< ref projects >}}) or [Posts]({{< ref posts >}}) when I get it figured out.

I'm also interested in crafting a more sustainable lifestyle for myself. I ty to engage in more low waste tendencies, bringing bags to the store, recycling, composting, eating what we buy. I commute to and from work on my [e-bike](https://ride1up.com/product/prodigy/) and run as many errands on it as I can, though I need to upgrade my kit for it. My backpack can only hold so much. Lately, I've found myself exploring as much of Solarpunk art, literature, and video(game) content as I can.
